# Grid-plus
A utility grid drawing library for canvas elements, meant for simple grid-based interaction games/simulations.

Comes preloaded with an instance of Conway's Game of Life to show the functionality, try it here!: https://caiden20000.github.io/Grid-plus/build/

Controls for Game of Life:
- Zoom with scroll wheel
- Middle click + drag to move
- Left click place
- Right click remove
- Space to increment time
- Right arrow to simulate as fast as possible
- Left arrow to reverse simulation

The basic navigation functionality is baked in to the grid system itself, making it easy to implement it on a canvas object.
